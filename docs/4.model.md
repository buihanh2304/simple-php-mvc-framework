### Create model file

Model files is placed in `app/models` folder.
Name of model class is name of model file, affix `Model`

Example: `app/models/User.php`
```php
class UserModel extends Model
{
    public function getUser($id)
    {
        $this->db->prepare('...');
    }
}
```
Then you can load Model to Controller with Loader
```php
$this->load->model('User');
```

`$this->db` is a PDO instance, so you can use all PDO method here.
