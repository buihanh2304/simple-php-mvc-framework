### Create model file

Model files is placed in `app/Models` folder.

Example: `app/Models/User.php`
```php
namespace App\Models;

class User extends Model
{
    public function getUser($id)
    {
        $this->db->prepare('...');
    }
}
```

`$this->db` is a PDO instance, so you can use all PDO method here.
