### Create library file

Library file is placed in `app/libraries` folder.
Name of Library class is name of Library file, affix Library.

Example: `app/libraries/User.php`
```php
class UserLibrary
{
    public function validateUser($id)
    {
        //
    }
}
```
Then you can load Library to Controller or Model with Loader
```php
$this->load->library('User');
```
