Container is a tool used for managing class instances in the application.

When you get a class instance with the same parameters from container, it will give you the same instance.

Example:
```php
$request = Container::make(Request::class);

$request2 = Container::make(Request::class);
```

In this case, $request and $request2 are the same instance of `system/Classes/Request.php`.
